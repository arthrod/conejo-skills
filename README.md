# arthrod's Skill Registry

**95 skills** — last sync `2026-05-18` (yolo mode). **v2.0.0**

Major restructure: families collapsed (Pi → 2 skills, Pydantic AI → 1 with `references/`,
Rust → `rust-author` + `rust-review`, Better Auth slimmed, design dials folded into `impeccable`),
new combined skills (`conejo` absorbs code-review + autofix + pr-triage-gh, `marimo` absorbs 4
marimo skills, `ml-gpu-training` absorbs CUDA setup). All design tools include a Stitch-first
mandate (`STITCH-DESIGN.md` in each design-skill folder).

## Sync

```bash
./scripts/update-skills.sh            # additive — only adds NEW skills (default, safe)
./scripts/update-skills.sh --yolo     # substitute — wipes ./skills/ and re-copies everything
DRY_RUN=1 ./scripts/update-skills.sh  # local only, no commit/push
SOURCE=/path ./scripts/update-skills.sh
```

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add arthrod/conejo-skills
/plugin install arthrod-skills
